# Aiden Assistant Arduino code
It is very likely you spend a lot of time on your phone, whether you want it or not. Social media apps are designed to
capture as much of our attention as possible. So how can technology help us become less distracted by our phones and
facilitate our lives, in particular in a social context? Aiden is a tool for young adults that aims to reduce
distraction by smartphone technology and raises awareness of their responsibility of building and maintaining human
relationships. It makes the phone less distracting by reducing message notifications and keeping it out of sight
whenever possible. An assistant is able to act on your behalf and respond to certain messages for you, keeping you
focussed on the road, in a restaurant or during that one conversation. In case you need to work or study, just place
your phone in the phone dock for minimal distraction. The assistant will be automatically activated.
